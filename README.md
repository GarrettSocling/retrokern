Retrokern
=========

Retrokern is a 16-bit x86 assembly-based "operating system" that aims to accomplish the following goals:

* Provide a teaching platform for x86 assembly
* Provide a simple non-DOS, completely free operating system for retro projects

This system requires absolutely no operating system and will boot (in theory) in any 8086 or later CPU, including modern x86_64 systems.
